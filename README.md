# ðŸš€ Getting Started with Create React App  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Available Scripts  

### ðŸ”¹ `npm start`  
- Runs the app in **development mode**.  
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  
- The page **reloads** when changes are made.  
- Lint errors are displayed in the console.  

### ðŸ”¹ `npm test`  
- Launches the **test runner** in interactive watch mode.  
- Refer to [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.  

### ðŸ”¹ `npm run build`  
- Builds the app for **production** in the `build/` folder.  
- React is **bundled and optimized** for performance.  
- The build is **minified**, and filenames include **hashes**.  
- The app is now **ready for deployment**!  
- More details: [Deployment Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).  

### ðŸ”¹ `npm run eject`  
- **Warning:** This is a **one-way operation** and **cannot be undone**!  
- Ejecting provides **full control** over Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.  
- Useful if customization is required beyond CRAâ€™s default setup.  
- Most users **donâ€™t need to eject**; CRAâ€™s built-in features are sufficient.
